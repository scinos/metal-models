# Batmobile: Batman vs Superman (2016)

The batmobile from the Batman vs. Superman movie was quite fun to build. The model didn't have many curved parts, which are always tricky to get right. It has some internal "walls" to serve as support between the bodywork and the chassis that were hard to get right as the tabs are virtually inaccessible once the bodywork is assembled.

Speaking of chassis and bodywork, this model has an interesting design for them. Other cars I've built feature a solid metal sheet for the chassis and another single piece for the main body. This one, however, has two separate pieces (front and back) for the chassis joined along the central axis with thin metal bands (visible in the bottom shot). The result is somewhat flexible, as the metal bands provide some hinge effect.

I love the strong presence of the wheels (especially the rear wheels). They are, in my opinion, one of the most catchy features of the "real" batmobile, and the amount of detail they have in this model makes them an eye-catcher.

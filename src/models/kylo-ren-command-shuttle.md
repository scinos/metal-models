# Star Wars: Kylo Ren's Command Shuttle

It's not as recognizable as other Star Wars models except for the hardcore fan, but I really like the glossy finish and how impressive the wings are.

Speaking of the wings, they are probably the easiest part to assemble. And conversely, the main body was a royal pain mostly because it has many non-right angles everywhere. The worst part is probably that it doesn't really show in the final model because the reflections from the glossy finish kind of hide all those subtle angles and details.

The rear turbines were hard but fun to assemble, as they are not a cylinder but a truncated cone.

I must admit I use some glue for this model, as the base was a bit flimsy and the tabs got easily detached after some manipulation.

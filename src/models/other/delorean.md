# DeLorean: Back to the Future

Staying with the theme of pop-culture cars, my next model was a DeLorean. The page or the instructions doesn't mention it's the Back to the Future car (It doesn't even have the Flux Capacitor or the Time Controls), but... come on, let's be honest, we all know why this model exists. I guess they have some licensing issues?

Anyway, this model is painted! That was a cool feature. It is not very noticeable, but the interior is white, there is red and yellow for the lights, and some parts are black. I was slightly concerned about the paint quality, but it is ok and reasonably resistant to scratches.

The model itself wasn't particularly fun to build. The bodywork is strange: the roof is not a solid piece and it sits in the black "frame" together with the doors and the windshield. It was very brittle, and I almost broke it a few times. In the end, I managed to fit it all together but I had to bend and twist the frame in weird ways.

I really like the detailed interior though. I love the seats, the wheel and there is even a tiny hand-brake! Also, I like the wheels, the rim is slightly concave and white, which gives the model a nice touch.

# Ironman

This is my first Premium (aka big) model. And I absolutely love it! It was very fun to build, challenging but not frustrating and the result is astounding.

It has the feeling of the real Ironman suit, in the sense that instead of having a single piece for a body part, you have layers of assembled pieces, like the real suit. This is very noticeable in the feet (with 7 pieces each) and the helmet (8 pieces). The model has a total of 112 pieces by the way.

The colors are vibrant and nice. However, it scratches very easily, and the many visible tabs end up losing the red coating. But as the metal itself is golden in color, it kind of fits with the overall look.

The downside is, as usual, the curved parts (which I guess will be common in any organic model). Getting the right bending in the torso was challenging, and I end up just forcing it until everybody fit together and only then try to give it a round-ish shape. In this regard, the ass-plate was particularly challenging.

Another detail that could be improved is the hands. The right-hand fingers have either 3 or 2 sides that are not linked together, just bent at the right angle. The result is a not very pleasing peeled-off effect. The left-hand fingers are just engraved, which looks better in my opinion, but still not great.

# Sydney Opera House

I have a love/hate relationship with this model.

On one hand, this is the very first model that I ever saw in real life a couple of years ago in a gift shop. I bought it but, due to lack of experience, I broke beyond repair before I was able to complete it. In fact, these pictures belong to a second model I bought very recently. Also, I lived in Sydney for a number of years and I have amazing pictures in the Opera House stairs with my family.

On the other hand, this model is a real pain. The shape of each dome is really weird and hard to get right, so it required lots of trial and error (that you can see in the form of scratches in the pictures). The instruction themselves are quite bad and, despite checking the official pictures, I got a few pieces bent backward anyway. I blame the very shiny finish, as it is hard to focus on small details with so many reflections.

I wouldn't recommend this model: it is just not fun to build, and it is not _that_ cool. I only built it for sentimental value.

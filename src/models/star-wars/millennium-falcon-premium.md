# Star Wars: Millenium Falcon (Premium)

This is one of my favorite models! I love the Millenium Falcon and it was also a gift from my lovely wife. It was also very fun to build, and being a Premium model (i.e. larger) makes it less brittle to work with.

I like how detailed the hull is, including the exhaust ports, the rear fins (I had to use glue for these by the way), the landing legs... The pedestal is quite sturdy, and while I still used some glue, it probably wasn't necessary.

The model has a few things that could be improved thought. The bend of the cockpit leaves a weird gap with the corridor (it is visible even in the official pictures), and the top/bottom cannons could be more detailed.

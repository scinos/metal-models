# Star Wars: Snowspeeder

My first [Metal Earth](https://www.metalearth.com/) model!

It looks really cool, but I can't help but notice the mistakes. The Laser Cannons are not straight by any means, and the rear Heat Dispersion Fins (yeah, I look up the actual name) are very wobbly.

Also, I broke a piece inside the cockpit, thankfully is not noticeable from the outside.

The most important lesson for this model is that you really need something to shape the round parts, it is very hard to get something resembling a cylinder with just a pair of tweezers. And while it is true you don't need glue at all, it certainly helps.

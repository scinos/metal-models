# Imperial AT-AT

This model was particularly challenging, but I really like the final result.

I expected to have some problems getting the perfect round shape for the feet but turns out it was exactly the same size as a Pilot pen I had on my desk, so in the end it was easy. Similar story for the neck, it was the same diameter as another pen I had around.

Surprisingly, the most challenging part was the body. It looks like three separate sections, but it is actually just one piece with some "inset" folds. The problem is that the body is not rectangular (the angle between the upper part and each left and right side is about 100Â°) so it was hard to find the right angle so everything fits together.

The legs and the ankles were very sturdy so the entire model is quite stable.
